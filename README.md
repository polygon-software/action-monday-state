# Set monday.com Item Status - Github Action

This simple github action parses a monday.com Item-ID from any text (like a PR Title) and sets the items state
on monday.com. 

[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=polygon-software_action-monday-state&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=polygon-software_action-monday-state)

This Github Action can be very useful in the following scenarios:
- Set item status to "In PR" if a PR is opened that mentions the Item in the PR Title
- Set item status as "Merged" if a PR is closed that mentions the Item in the PR Title
- etc.

## Usage

In the following example, the Github Action is used to set the Status Column "Development Stage"
for the Monday Item mentioned in the PR title to the status "In PR". 

The PR Title could look as follows: *fix(main): Solved Bug that prevented login #1234567890*
where _1234567890_ is of course the monday.com item ID. 

```yaml

          text: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}

```
